**Information Architecture and Navigation**
<!-- TODO: Make a Diagram -->
Unfortunately, there wasn't time to make the diagram that would reflect the final structure of the website. The diagram would be similar to the one below, but with updated pages and functionalities. That one is, unfortunatelly, done by hand and even more unfortunatelly, it's done by **my** hand.

- **Wireframes:** The wireframes were created using Balsamiq. The wireframes were created for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The wireframes were created for the following pages: Home, Register, Login, Profile, Add Book, Edit Book, Delete Book, Book Details, Favourites, User Added Books, Contact, and 404.

[Link to Wireframes](./docs/wireframes/initial_wireframes_balsamiq.pdf)

_N.B. The wireframes were created before the project was started. The final project will abundantly differ from the wireframes._

#### SURFACE

##### Colour Scheme
[Sunny Bay Bridge color combination](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/sunny-bay-bridge/)

![colour scheme](./docs/images/colour_scheme.png)

This colour scheme is used throughout the website. To it the standard Bootstrap colours are added. It is a nice and clean colour scheme that is easy on the eyes and doesn't disctract the user from the content.

##### Typography

Monserrat Alternates is used for the logo and headings. Roboto Serif is used for the body text. Mooli is used for the book titles. They are all [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


##### Imagery
The images were created with DALL-E 2, a neural network that generates images from text descriptions. Other images were taken from unsplash. For details see [Credits](#credits).

##### Branding
A logo is created that reflect the essence of "Books for Life." Nothing fancy, just a simple logo that is easy to remember and recognisable (B4L). The tool used is the online [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) generator.

![Books for Life logo](./docs/images/android-chrome-192x192.png)

##### Prototypes
Given the time constraints, the website was not prototyped. The website was built using the wireframes as a guide.

##### Feedback and Iteration
Generally, the developer relied on the feedback from the mentor and the peer-code review to improve the website. The developer also relied on the feedback from some other users to improve the website. The constant changing of the website functionalities and design was a result of the feedback received.

[Back to top ⇧](#table-of-contents)

## Accessibility
Website complies with accessibility standards. The Lighthouse Validation was used to check the website for accessibility issues. The website is fully accessible.

## Database Design
Database design was made with [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/). The database is hosted on ElephantSQL and is a PostgreSQL database.

![Database Design](./docs/images/quickdbd_database_diagram.png)

- **UserProfile** Model extends the AbstractUser Model. The UserProfile Model is used to store additional information about the user, in this case a profile picture. It's activated once the user takes an action that requires a profile picture, that is updating the profile data.
- **Book** Model has fields _title, author, slug, short_description, full_description, image_url, likes,_ and _user_. The user field is a foreign key to the UserProfile Model. The likes in fact is not, stricly saying, the field of the book. It's Many to Many connection that generates a linking model between Book record and User record. The slug field is used to create a unique URL for each book. The slug field is automatically generated from the title and there's a custom save method that checks if the slug is unique. If it's not unique, a number is added to the slug. The slug field is used in the URL to identify the book. The id is used to identify the book in the database. The id is used in the URL to identify the book and it's generate automatically.
- **Category** model is a simple one. Other than id that is generated automatically, it has only a multiple choice field name. The name field is used to identify the category in the database. It is a One to Many relationship between Category and Book models. The original idea was to have Many to Many model, but there wasn't time for implementation.

On the right, there are links to the Register and Login pages. If the user is logged in, the links to the Register and Login pages are replaced with the links to the Profile with a small profile image icon and Logout pages. Similarly, left of them, there are links Add Book, My Books and My Favourites that lead to the corresponding pages, and they also appear only on successfull login. The links are responsive and collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
For the profile image there's a default image that is used if the user doesn't upload their own image.

#### Footer
Footer is based on a template from [MdBootstrap Documentation](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/navigation/footer/). It contains links to the social media accounts of the website. The links open in a new tab. At the bottom, there are copywrite information. There's a JS code that takes care of the fotter's possibility to stick to the bottom of the page.

Navbar and Footer are the common elements for all the pages of the website.

#### Messages
In-built Django messages system is used to inform the user about the actions they took. The messages are displayed on the top of the page. The messages are responsive and disappear after a few seconds.

#### Homepage
On the homepage there are animations, images and a short description of the website. The animations are made with CSS and Javascript. The animations and contents are responsive. There are also buttons to My Books and My Profile Page.

#### Login/Register Pages
Login and Register Pages are simple pages with forms for login and registration. The forms are made with html and are controlled by views in Django. The forms are responsive. The forms are validated on the client side and the server side. The forms are validated on the client side with HTML5 validation. The final result is a new user record in the database. After the user is registered, the user is redirected to the My Books Page. After the user is logged in, the user is redirected to the My Books Page.

#### Contact Page
Contact Page is a simple page with a contact form. The form is made with EmailJS. The form is responsive. The form is validated on the client side and the server side.

The form is validated on the client side with HTML5 validation. The final result is a list of books that match the search criteria.
There's a search field in which a user can write their queries. The button next to the search field triggers the search. The search works for the data that include titles, authors and categories of the books. If the input field is not empty, the clear search buttton appears. The clear search button clears the search field. If the input field is empty, the clear search button disappears. The search results are ordered by the date of creation of the book record.
The nuber of found records appears above the table. Table has as columns number (sequential), Author, TItle, Category, and like. On smaller screens, numbers and categories columns dissapear. The book can be liked or unliked by clicking on the heart icon. Unliked book has a blue shallow animated heart, liked the red solid animated heart. The implementation isn't perfect, because every (un)liking refreshes the page, and if there are many books, the pages moves to the top.
User can click on the title of the book to be redirected to the book details page.

#### Book Details Page
To this page the user is redirected when they click on the title of the book in the search results on Finda A Book Page, on My Books Page or on My Favourites Page. The page contains all the information about the book. The page is responsive. The page contains the title, author, image, full description, date of addition, category and the number of likes.
There's a Back button to bring the user back to the page from which they came to the Book Details. It is not he perfect solution, but it's the best that could be done in the time given.
There's also the possibility to like or unlike a book like on the Find a Book Page.

#### My Books Page
My Books Page is a page with a table of books added by the user. The page is responsive. The table has as columns number (sequential), Author, Title, Category, and like. On smaller screens, numbers and categories columns dissapear. The book can be edited or deleted by clicking on the relative buttons on the right of the record. The user can click on the title of the book to be redirected to the book details page.
At the bootom of the page is Add a Book button that brings the user to the Add Book Page.
By clicking on the Edit button, the user is redirected to the Edit Book Page. By clicking on the Delete button, the user is redirected to the Delete Book Page.

#### Edit Book Page
Edit Book Page is a form for editing a book record. The form is made with html and is controlled by a view in Django. Only non required filed is the image. The form is validated on the client side and the server side.
The form is prepopulated with the data from the book record. The user can edit the data and submit the form. The final result is an updated book record in the database. After the book is edited, the user is redirected to the My Books Page.
If the user clicks on the Cancel button, they are redirected to the My Books Page without any changes in the record of the database.

#### Delete Book Page
Delete Book Page is a simple one. It contains the details of the book record: title, author, image, and short description.
There are also a confirmation message and two buttons. If the user clicks on the Delete button, the book record is deleted from the database and the user is redirected to the My Books Page. If the user clicks on the Cancel button, they are redirected to the My Books Page without any changes in the record of the database.
The original idea was to have a modal for the confirmation message on My Books Page, but there wasn't time for implementation.

### My Favourites Page

To arrive to Profile Page, user can click or on the button on the Homepage or on the link in the Navbar (that is, a round profile image with username on the right). The page contains the user's profile image, username and email. There are two buttons: Edit Profile and Delete Profile. By clicking on the Edit Profile button, the user is redirected to the Edit Profile Page.
By clicking on the Delete Profile button, the Delete Profile modal is called for the confirmation. If confirmed, the user is redirected to the Homepage and their profile is deleted from the database. The same deletion causes the deletion of all the books added by the user. The user is logged out and the session is terminated. If the user clicks on the Cancel button, they are back to the Profile Page without any changes in the record of the database.

#### Edit Profile Page
Edit Profile Page is a simple form that gives the user the possibility to change their email, pasword and profile image. The form is made with Django, and is controlled by a view in Django. The form is validated on the client side and the server side. The form is prepopulated with the data from the user record. The user can edit the data and submit the form.

If the user clicks on the Cancel button, they are redirected to the Profile Page without any changes in the record of the database.
#### Custom Error Page
Custom 404 Error Page is made with Django. It is a simple page with a message and a large round image that changes from grayscale to colour on hoverm and by clicking on it, the user comes back to the Homepage.

#### Favicon
Favicons are made by the online [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) generator. The favicon is a simple B4L logo that is self explanatory and recognizable.
#### Future Features
In early stages, the idea was to have a rich text editor for the book descriptions. The idea was to use Summernote. The implementation wasn't successful, and the idea was partialy abandoned. The idea is to implement it in the future.
The idea was to have a dedicated page for the categories in order to add a new category. The idea was to have a Many to Many relationship between the Book and Category models. The idea was to implement it in the future.
Another idea was to have a details of the contributing user on the book detail page, and to be able to see all the users and their books on the dedicated page. The idea was to implement it in the future. 
Obviously, there was the idea of implementing the administrator's access and different functionalities. Especially the control of the deletions (books and users) and the control of the categories. In that way, the deletion couldn't be automatic, but controlled by requests to Administrator.
Developer wanted to implement the pagination for all the tables, but there wasn't time for that. The idea is to implement it in the future.

## Issues and Bugs
- *Book Deletion Modal*
    - **Issue:** The idea was to have a modal for the confirmation message on My Books Page, but there wasn't time for implementation. The attempt to add modal resulted in making automatic modal for the deletion for each record. That was not the desired result.
- *Book Liking*
    - **Issue:** The implementation isn't perfect, because every (un)liking refreshes the page, and if there are many books, the pages moves to the top. The developer tried to implement it without using JS, but that didn't give the desired result.
- *Back Button*
    - **Issue:** The idea was to have a Back button that would bring the user back to the page from which they came to the Book Details. It is not he perfect solution. It uses a navigation history to go one step back. If the book is (un)liked, and page refreshes, that back needs to be pressed a few times to get the user back to the desired page without refreshing the cache.
- *Book Short Description*
    - **Issue:** In early stages, the idea was to have a modal showing on book title clicked with only a short description and the button read more that would bring to the Book detail page. But, there wasn't time for full implementation.
- *Directory Structure*
    - **Issue:** The directory structure is not the best. The developer tried to make it as logical as possible, but there's a lot of room for improvement. The templates in the authors app are not following the ideal structure (/templates/app-name/...). Unfortunatelly, the developer realised that too late and didn't want to compromise the functionality of the website by changing the structure.

## Testing
For Testing details go to a separated file [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)


## Deployment
### Local Deployment

In order to make a local copy of this project, you can clone it. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone the repository:

- `git clone https://github.com/tomdu3/books-for-life.git`

If done locally, the virtual environment needs to be created and activated. To do so, in your IDE Terminal, type the following commands:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

If on Linux/MacOS, type the following command for activation:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
On Windows type the following command for activation:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/tomdu3/books-for-life)

***

After cloning or opening the repository in Gitpod, you will need to:

1. Create your own `.env` file in the root level of the project:

```
SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key]
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://[api_key]:[api_secret]@[cloud_name]
```
**Ensure the `.env` file is added to your `.gitignore` file so it doesn't get pushed to a public repository.

If you don't have a Cloudinary account already, you will need to [Sign Up for Free](https://cloudinary.com/users/register/free) to host the static files in the project.

2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

3. Migrate the database models using:
`python3 manage.py migrate`

4. Create a superuser with your own credentials:
`python3 manage.py migrate`

5. Run the Django sever:
`python manage.py runserver`
The address of the server will appear in the terminal window.
Add /admin to the address to access the Django admin panel using your superuser credentials.

### Heroku Deployment

Sign up to [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) for free if you don't already have an account.

1. Create a new app in Heroku.

2. In the Resources tab of your app in the Heroku dashboard, click Add-Ons and select Heroku Postgres. Select Hobby Dev - Free as your plan.

3. When Heroku Postgres is installed, click the Settings tab in the Heroku Dashboard.
Click Reveal Config Vars, and add the same variables from your `.env` file here, except for `DEBUG`, as you don't want debug mode on the deployed project.

4. Copy the value of `DATABASE_URL` from the Config Vars. In your `settings.py` file, comment out the default database configuration, and add a new one with the Postgres url.

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse('your DATABASE_URL here'),
}
```

5. Migrate the database models using:
`python3 manage.py migrate`

6. Create a superuser with your own credentials:
`python3 manage.py migrate`

7. Create a file called `Procfile` (no extension) containing the following:
```
web: gunicorn core.wsgi
```

8. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install required Python packages.

9. Add the url of your Heroku app ('https://books-4-life-2d26bdf04dec.herokuapp.com/') to your `settings.py` file:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    'books-4-life-2d26bdf04dec.herokuapp.com',...
]
```

10. Disable collect static so that Heroku doesn't try to collect static files when you deploy by adding the following to your Heroku Config Vars in the Settings tab of Heroku dashboard:

```
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
```

The same variable has to be removed from Heroku Config Vars when you want to collect static files (for the testing and final deployment).

11. Stage and commit your files to GitHub
```
git add . 
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
```

12. In the Heroku dashboard for your App, select Deploy.
Under Deployment Method, choose GitHub and search for your repository and click Connect.

13. Select Enable Automatic Deployments, and then Deploy Branch. Heroku will build the App from the branch you selected.

14. Now whenever you push your commits to GitHub, Heroku will rebuild the application.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The project can be forked in order to make a copy of the original repository and propose changes to the project owner using Pull Requests.
That can be done by following these steps:
First, log in to GitHub and locate the [Project's Repository](github.com/tomdu3/books-for-life).
At the top of the Repository, on the right side of the page, locate the "Fork" button.
A copy of the Repository should now be in your GitHub account.
You can now propose changes to the Repository by creating a Pull Request.
